- Which edge cases should you consider with this component?
* Empty state.
* Error state.
* Lazy loading.
* Long data returned (Pagination will be required).

- Which ones would you address in an initial v0 release, and which ones might you include in later iterations?
* For v0 I will care about the first 3 (Empty, Error, Lazy Load).
* I will do the pagination in a later iteration.
